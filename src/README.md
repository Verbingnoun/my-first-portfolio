# Josh Stephenson T1A2 - Portfolio

Deployed site : [joshstephenson](https://josh-stephenson.netlify.app/index.html)

## Site Description 

1. Purpose - To demonstrate my skills in html and css to potential employers or clients. To build upon the site as I gain more skill and experience within html and become competent in other technologies such as Javascript.

2. Functionality/features - By design I kept the functionality and features of the site very simple. This is to keep in line with my current skill level and to give the site room to grow as I attain new skills throughout my career. All pages feature and header and footer which stick to the top and bottom of the page respectively, a hamburger menu for mobile viewports and a standard navbar for tablet viewports and over. A few simple animations and transitions were added to the technology icons on [about](https://josh-stephenson.netlify.app/about.html) and the navigation bar to give the user a more interactive experience.
